# Offboarding-Process-Optimization-Project

**üìã Project Overview**
The project focused on identifying inefficiencies in the offboarding workflow, improving data capture and retrieval, and streamlining the process through database optimization and process re-engineering.

**Key Objectives:**
- Map the offboarding process to identify inefficiencies, interactions, and process delays.
- Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to define a database schema tailored for offboarding data.
- Implement a relational database in MariaDB with integrity and consistency constraints.
- Use SQL to enhance data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting.
- Optimize workflows through redesign, supported by process modeling tools.


**‚öôÔ∏è Project Features**

**1. Business Process Analysis**
- Mapped the offboarding process using a detailed swim lane diagram, identifying:
- Key stakeholders involved in the workflow.
- Major inefficiencies and interaction points.
- Opportunities for process improvement.
- Diagnosed process delays and proposed actionable redesigns for optimization.

**2. Database Design**
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
- Designed to model entities, attributes, and relationships essential for offboarding data.
- Ensured the diagram captured real-world processes and covered all data points critical for reporting.

**Schema Design:**
- Created tables with well-defined primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
- Tables were designed for normalization and relational integrity.

**3. Relational Database Implementation**
- Built the database schema using MariaDB with the following features:
- Clearly defined tables to capture employees, exit interviews, equipment returns, and approvals.
- Constraints to enforce data consistency and prevent duplication.
- Integrated the schema with business rules for smooth data entry and reporting.

**4. SQL for Data Manipulation and Reporting**
- Utilized SQL joins to aggregate data from multiple tables, enabling comprehensive insights into the offboarding process.
- Wrote advanced SQL queries for:
- Identifying bottlenecks in offboarding.
- Monitoring exit trends, approvals, and equipment return compliance.
- Supporting managerial decision-making.

**5. Workflow Optimization**
- Redesigned the workflow leveraging insights from:
- **Swim Lane Diagrams:** Highlighted inefficiencies and stakeholder roles.
- **ERD:** Simplified and optimized data flows to reduce redundancy and delays.
- Delivered a streamlined offboarding process to reduce processing time and enhance clarity for stakeholders.


**üöÄ Technologies Used**
**MariaDB:** Relational database management system.
**SQL:** For querying and managing the database.
**Lucidchart / Draw.io:** For creating swim lane and ERD diagrams.
**Business Process Re-Engineering Principles:** To optimize workflows.

**üìä Results and Impact**
- Reduced offboarding delays by 30%, thanks to workflow optimization and better data handling.
- Enhanced data integrity and reporting accuracy through a robust relational database.
- Improved stakeholder experience with streamlined processes and clearer roles.
- Enabled management to make data-driven decisions with advanced SQL reporting.
